# Udacity | P8: Neighborhood Map - Project Explained
This repo contains the code that I wrote in a [Series of YouTube Videos about building the Neighborhood Map Project from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgOB68PvvmWCGNn8UMTpcfQEiITzxEEA1)!

## Disclaimer
Quoted from Udacity:
> We expect you to do your own work as you build this project. Avoid using code from other student projects or open-source projects to build your application, even with citation.

Don't use this code as a way of cheating to submit it as your own project and get graduated, this might lead to a bad ending with Udacity as it violates [Udacity Honor Code and Community Code of Conduct](https://www.udacity.com/legal/community-guidelines)!

## The Purpose
Mainly, the purpose of all of this is to help my fellow students at [Google Developer Scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships) - Front End Web Developer Nanodegree - who have been with me since 9 months (October 2017!) ðŸ’“

As most of them have been struggling with this project because of its complexity, so I decided to walk-through the first steps of the `Neighborhood Map` without using too much external things, especially for the `Map` Component, I only used `Vanilla JavaScript` + `Google Maps API`!

## Setup Instructions
- `git clone https://github.com/elharony/Udacity-P8-Neighborhood-Map-Project-Explained.git`
- `cd Udacity-P8-Neighborhood-Map-Project-Explained`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

A Live Preview will opens via `http://localhost:3000/` by your default browser!

## App History
After each video, I do a `commit`. So, if you want to back to the app when we have just added the `Markers`, you should do the following:
- `git log --oneline` you will see a bunch of commits, the one we are looking for is: `4cdf80f`
- `git checkout 4cdf80f` Now, the App went back to how it was at the end of [Add Dynamic Markers](https://youtu.be/nDJ00zO9X2U) video!

And so on...

## Contributing
If you really want to contribute, share the videos with anyone of your friends who might get stuck at The `Neighborhood Map` Project. Or if you know someone who is starting to work with React and wants to build a Real-World Application, these videos would help!

## Feedback
I am not a Professional Instructor nor a YouTuber yet... I've been struglling A LOT to get that Sound Quality which is really good compared to my [Udcaity | P3: Memory Game - Study Jam](https://github.com/elharony/Udacity-Study-Jam-FEND-P3-Memory-Game). But, I am sure that there is better. So, if you have any feedback to improve the video quality including; Screen Recording, Sound Quality, or even the Content itself...
